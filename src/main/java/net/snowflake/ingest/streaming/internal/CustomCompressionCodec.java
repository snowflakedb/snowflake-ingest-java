/**
 * This is custom wrapper on top of {@link CompressionCodec} implementations.
 *
 * <p>The main stream {@link CompressionCodec} implementations are based on {@link
 * org.apache.arrow.vector.compression.AbstractCompressionCodec}. This implementation is similar to
 * it with some tweaks.
 *
 * <p>The reason to have this custom implementation is to fix certain issues with mainstream codecs
 * that lead to buffer reference counting problems due to creation of new compressed buffers and
 * releasing uncompressed. The release of uncompressed buffer from the original vectors to write
 * into file results in double release when the original vector gets released as usual.
 *
 * <p>The custom code extraction is not optimal in a long term and there is a TODO: SNOW-629844 - to
 * follow up on this.
