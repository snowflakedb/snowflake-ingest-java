The Snowflake Ingest Service SDK allows users to ingest files into their
Snowflake data warehouse in a programmatic fashion via key-pair
authentication. Currently, we support ingestion through the following APIs:
1. [Snowpipe](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-rest-gs.html#client-requirement-java-or-python-sdk)
2. [Snowpipe Streaming](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-streaming-overview) - Under Public Preview

# Prerequisites

**If your project depends on the Snowflake JDBC driver, as well, please make sure the JDBC driver version is 3.13.30 or newer.**

## Java 8+

The Snowflake Ingest Service SDK can only be used with Java 8 or higher.
Backwards compatibility with Java 7 and prior is not planned at this
time.

## A 2048-bit RSA key pair

Snowflake Authentication for the Ingest Service requires creating a 2048
bit RSA key pair and, registering the public key with Snowflake. For
detailed instructions, please visit the relevant [Snowflake
Documentation Page](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth.html).

## Maven (Developers only)

This SDK is developed as a Maven project. As a
result, you'll need to install Maven to build the projects and, run
tests.

# Adding as a Dependency

You can add the Snowflake Ingest Service SDK by adding the following to
your project

``` {.xml}
<!-- Add this to your Maven project's pom.xml -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>net.snowflake</groupId>
    <artifactId>snowflake-ingest-sdk</artifactId>
    <version>{version}</version>
</dependency>
```

``` {.groovy}
// in Gradle project
dependencies {
    compile 'net.snowflake:snowflake-ingest-sdk:{version}'
}
```

# Example

## Snowpipe

Check out `SnowflakeIngestBasicExample.java`

## Snowpipe Streaming

Check out `SnowflakeStreamingIngestExample.java`, which performs following operations:
1. Reads a JSON file which contains details regarding Snowflake Account, User, Role and Private Key. Take a look at `profile_streaming.json.example` for more details.
    1. [Here](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth.html#configuring-key-pair-authentication) are the steps required to generate a private key.
2. Creates a `SnowflakeStreamingIngestClient` which can be used to open one or more Streaming Channels pointing to the same or different tables.
3. Creates a `SnowflakeStreamingIngestChannel` against a Database, Schema and Table.
    1. Please note: The database, schema and table is expected to be present before opening the Channel. Example SQL queries to create them:
```sql
create or replace database MY_DATABASE;
create or replace schema MY_SCHEMA;
create or replace table MY_TABLE(c1 number);
```
4. Inserts 1000 rows into the channel created in 3rd step using the `insertRows` API on the Channel object
    1. `insertRows` API also takes in an optional `offsetToken` String which can be associated to this batch of rows.
5. Calls `getLatestCommittedOffsetToken` on the channel until the appropriate offset is found in Snowflake.
6. Close the channel when the ingestion is done to make sure everything is committed.

# Building From Source

If you would like to build this project from source you can run the
following to install the artifact to your local maven repository.

``` {.bash}
mvn install
```

If you would just like to build the jar in the source directory, you can
run

``` {.bash}
mvn package
```

However, for general usage, pulling a pre-built jar from maven is
recommended.

If you would like to run SnowflakeIngestBasicExample.java or SnowflakeStreamingIngestExample.java in the example folder, 
please edit `pom.xml` and change the scope of the dependency `slf4j-simple` from `test` to `runtime` in order to enable
console log output.


# Testing (SimpleIngestIT Test)

-   Modify `TestUtils.java` file and replace *PROFILE_PATH* with `profile.json.example` for testing.

    -   `profile.json` is used because an encrypted file will be
            decrypted for Github Actions testing. Check `End2EndTest.yml`

-   Use an unencrypted version(Only for testing) of private key while generating keys(private and public pair) using OpenSSL.

    -   Here is the link for documentation [Key Pair
            Generator](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth.html)
